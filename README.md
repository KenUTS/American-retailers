==============================

The task at hand involves the development of two distinct models that will be subsequently deployed as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in a production environment.

This study proposes the development of a prediction model utilising a Machine Learning algorithm to effectively forecast the sales income of a particular item within a designated retailer on a specific day.

This study proposes the utilisation of a time-series analysis method to develop a forecasting model aimed at predicting the aggregate sales income for all stores and items over the forthcoming seven-day period.
